# Code of Conduct

Inspired by [the Sandia values](https://hr.sandia.gov/career/performance-management/sandia-values/), contributors are required to do the following:

- **Act with integrity.** Trust is a fragile thing, so be honest and responsible.
- **Deliver with excellence.** Standards are high for code performance, style, and testing.
- **Respect each other.** Criticize ideas, not people, and treat everyone with innate dignity.
- **Team up for great results.** Combine knowledge and skillsets for the best outcome, and help each other.
